              Hi there! Iâ€™m Steven Norris, a passionate Software Development
              student with a keen interest in crafting innovative and imagintive
              solutions through code. Currently on track to graduate in 2025. My
              journey in software development is fueled by a desire to
              continuously learn and push the boundaries of what's possible.

              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest trends in
              tech, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into new
              challenges that sharpen my problem-solving abilities. Whether it's
              building web applications, developing software tools, or
              automating processes, I'm always ready to take on the next big
              project.
